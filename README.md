# Smart-Room-Controller

## Overview

I created this project as part of CNM's IoT Bootcamp. I was inspired to create this because hearing problems run in my family and I am very passionate about creating technology that is accessible for all.

## Summary
This doorbell uses lights to let the user know when someone is at their door. The LED lights up when motion is detected at the door, and the NeoPixels light up when someone is ringing the doorbell. The Hue lights and wemos also come on when the doorbell is rung. This doorbell has a buzzer so it also works like a typical doorbell.
